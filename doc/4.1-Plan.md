### Analysis
In this assignment, the goal is to convert this working program into a more Object-Ordinated program. There are many reasons one might do this, but specifically in this project, the purpose is to be able to easily implement new fractals, color pallets, functionalities, and more with ease.
The first big difference in the changes that will be made is the user interface. Instead of taking one fractal name for it to print out, the program will now take in a .frac file which holds all the information needed to print out a fractal.
Furthermore, a new argument is being added: the palette name. What this means is the user can now pick from certain palettes to change how the fractal output looks like. Additionally, both of these fields are optional, meaning if the user doesn't give either argument, it will result in the program choosing the default fractal and palette.

In making this program more object-oriented, there will be a few changes to the palette and fractal class. For one, the palette class will be broken into an abstract class which holds all the information about what a palette needs, and two concrete subclasses which will provide the needed information.
I will also make it so it raises a not implemented error if some needed method is not implemented.
The PaletteFactory module will also be added so making a concrete palette a lot easier.

Similar to the palette abstract class and 2 concrete classes, with the added paletteFactory, the fractal class will do those same things.
In addition, a fractalParser is going to be implemented with the purpose of reading the .frac file and turning it into a dictionary that the FractalFactory and PaletteFactory can use.
Other than that, there is a lot of small details like what the default values should be and what each thing should do, but this is the general overview of the project.

The biggest challenge that I oversee is just understanding how to make a good abstract and concrete class, and where each moving piece should be. 
Other than that, I don't think this assignment should be that hard, but I could certainly be wrong.

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*

### Palette Class
This abstract class's main purpose is to supply the basic structure of what a palette needs. It should be pretty basic; it needs a list of colors, generated from the colour import, and a ```getColor()``` method.
Furthermore, this class needs to raise a notImplementedError if the inherited class of the Palette doesn't add the necessary methods.

Should look something like...
```
Class Palette
    define getColor(self)
        raise a not implemented error
    Possibly more helpful methods
```

Next is the actual Palette classes (at least two). These will actually hold the dynamically created list of colors, as well as their individual implementation of the getColor method.
These objects also need to be dynamically created, meaning that I cannot have a hard coded list of color strings. What this means is that this class will have to take in some user input (the number of iterations) and create a color gradient based on that.
```
import colour
class SpecificColorPalette(Palette): # inherits from Palette
    color list []
    define starting color
    define color to transition to
    for each color in starting color range_to transition color, in some amount of steps (user handed)
        append to color list (color.hex_l)
       
    get color method (N)
        return list at spot N
    
```

### Palette Factory
The paletteFactory is one that I am not 100% on how it will look at the end. It kind of depends on how I want to implement it, and what information I need it to pass in. Needless to say, this one I will likely change many times before I get something I like.
However, the basic idea is that the PaletteFactory creates an object of a specific color palette class and returns that object.
This will consequently make the main.py look a lot cleaner.

This is my basic idea of how it should look...

```
import all the different concrete color palettes

def make_palette(default case name, default case iteration)
    if palette name is palette1 
        create palette 1 with whatever iteration defined
        return the palette object
    elif palette name is palette2 
        create palette 2 with whatever iteration defined
        return the palette object
     ... More cases ...
     else 
        usage error and exit
        
```
### Fractal Class
The Fractal class is similar to the Palette class. It is an abstract class that all the Fractal object will inherit from.
This class will have a abstract method ```count()``` that will take one complex number, do some magic, and return a integer or iteration number.

```
Class Fractal
    define count(self)
        raise a not implemented error
    Possibly more helpful methods
```

### Fractal Factory
The Fractal factory is very similar to the Palette Factory
It is used to instantiate the Fractal objects and then return the fractal.
It will also have a default value when no values are passed into it. It will not be a path, but rather a hardcoded values.

```
import all the different concrete fractals

def makeFractal(default fractal, default values #Not sure exactly what's needed yet)
    if fractal name is fractal1 
        create fractal 1 with whatever value defined
        return the fractal object
    elif fractal name is fractal2 
        create fractal 2 with whatever value defined
        return the fractal object
     ... More cases ...
     else 
        usage error and exit
```

### Fractal Parser
This is arguably the hardest part of the code. The purpose of this module is to read a .frac (doesn't have to be necessarily) file and find all the corresponding data to then create a dictionary which the fractal factory can use.
It has to also raise some errors if certain information is not supplied as well as handle optional data if given.
This function also checks if all the 

```
def FractalParser(fractal file name)
    define empty dictionary
    file is = opened fractal file
    for each line in file:
        ignore lines that start with #
        strip white space
        lower case everything
        split the line by :
        run safeConvert with whatever the key and value is
        left side is key, right side is value
        add it to the dictionary
    close the file
    
def safeConvert(key, obj)
    if the key is 'centerx'
        if not type float:
        raise ValueError("Second argument must be a valid Python type")
    try:
        return float(obj)
    except ValueError:
        return None
    if the key is 'centery'
        if not type float:
        raise ValueError("Second argument must be a valid Python type")
    try:
        return float(obj)
    except ValueError:
        return None
    ... Do the same thing for axislength, pixels, iteration, creal and cimag
```

I plan to implement new fractals once I finish all of the above stated functions, but I will also include a basic design for the fractals I want to add.
I'm not sure exactly which ones I want yet but I might try the spider and higher mandelbrot power. These are, in my opinion, the easiest, so I might add more in the future.

### Spider
```
def Spider(complex number c, iteration)
    z = 0
    for each number in iteration
        z = z squared + c
        c = c/2 + z
        if abs(num) > 2
        return num
    return iteration
```

### Mandelbrot Cubed
```
def MandelbrotCubed(complex number c, iteration)
    z = complex(0, 0)
    PaletteLen = PaletteLen - 1     
    for iter in range(PaletteLen):
        z = z * z * z + complexNum
        if abs(z) > 2:
            return iter
    return PaletteLen
```

### Unit Test
Essentially all my test need to be rewritten. So I will give a brief explanation of what I'm going to test (More will be added once I figure out what I can test aka once some of the code is written).
```
1. Test the getColor function on the Palette object
2. Test the Palette Factory to see if there is the correct number of colors
3. Test if the Fractal Parser handles correct data file and gives correct dictionary
```

## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.

### Implementing New Test Cases
In the process of creating the new code, I found it a lot easier to create new unit test along the way. This is because as I began coding, the things I thought were important to test would become apparent. 
In the beginning, I was hesitant to write all my unit test until I better understood what I was making. This was a good thing because I was able to make really good test that actually serve a purpose.
While it may be not following the step-by-step for this assignment, I found that this is the way that works best for me, and helps me make the most helpful code.
Regardless, here are the changes to the unit test that I made:
1. Test whether creating a Fractal class and Palette class would raise a ```NotImplementedError```.
   * Additionally, I roughly learned how to write a unit test that checks for types of errors using the ```with``` command.
2. Rewrote the ```Mandelbrot```, ```Phoenix```, and ```imagePainter``` tests so it would have the same functionality but work with the new implementations
3. Created a ```palette``` test that would create all my different palettes with a given iteration and check whether the length of the color palette is correct.
    * One thing I needed to change about my palette was adding a isOdd functionality that would add one to avoid under-adding the correct number of colors
    * This is because I am finding the half point of iterations to transition between, but if the iteration is odd, it will cut it in half and round down.

### What I Learned
There is honestly so much I learned! Overall, though, the one big thing that I learned is how to write code that is both clean and able to implement new changes easily.
What was really cool to me was the code I made was so sleek that my friend that has very little computer science was able to add his own palette following the similar pattern my palette.
This demonstrates that the code is easy to comprehend and easy to change.

I learned about python inheritance and polymorphism and how to use them effectively. Also I think I just have a better understanding of how fractals work and how my program works.
There are so many other things I have learned, like raising certain errors and creating default values, but it would take too long to write all of them.

Also side note, ChatGPT helped me in figuring out what functions I should use to achieve certain results (like ```with``` and stuff with inheritance), but didn't really write a lot of my code. 
It simply was an aid for my understanding of these topics.

    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
