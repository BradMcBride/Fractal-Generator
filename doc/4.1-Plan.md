### Analysis
In this assignment, the goal is to convert this working program into a more Object-Ordinated program. There are many reasons one might do this, but specifically in this project, the purpose is to be able to easily implement new fractals, color pallets, functionalities, and more with ease.
The first big difference in the changes that will be made is the user interface. Instead of taking one fractal name for it to print out, the program will now take in a .frac file which holds all the information needed to print out a fractal.
Furthermore, a new argument is being added: the palette name. What this means is the user can now pick from certain palettes to change how the fractal output looks like. Additionally, both of these fields are optional, meaning if the user doesn't give either argument, it will result in the program choosing the default fractal and palette.

In making this program more object-oriented, there will be a few changes to the palette and fractal class. For one, the palette class will be broken into an abstract class which holds all the information about what a palette needs, and two concrete subclasses which will provide the needed information.
I will also make it so it raises a not implemented error if some needed method is not implemented.
The PaletteFactory module will also be added so making a concrete palette a lot easier.

Similar to the palette abstract class and 2 concrete classes, with the added paletteFactory, the fractal class will do those same things.
In addition, a fractalParser is going to be implemented with the purpose of reading the .frac file and turning it into a dictionary that the FractalFactory and PaletteFactory can use.
Other than that, there is a lot of small details like what the default values should be and what each thing should do, but this is the general overview of the project.

The biggest challenge that I oversee is just understanding how to make a good abstract and concrete class, and where each moving piece should be. 
Other than that, I don't think this assignment should be that hard, but I could certainly be wrong.

## Phase 1: Design (tag name `4.1-designed`)
*(30% of your effort)*

**Important - do not change the code in this phase**

Deliver:

*   [ ] Function signatures that include:
    *   Descriptive names.
    *   Parameter lists.
    *   Documentation strings that explain its purpose and types of inputs and outputs.
*   [ ] Pseudocode that captures how each function works.
    *   Pseudocode != source code.  Do not paste your finished source code into this part of the plan.
*   Explain what happens in the face of good and bad input.
    *   Write a few specific examples that occur to you, and use them later when testing.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-designed` and push it to GitLab.
    *   *Grace Points: if this tag is pushed before class on the Monday before the due date, you will receive up to 5 points back*


## Phase 2: Implementation (tag name `4.1-implemented`)
*(15% of your effort)*

**Finally, you can write code!**

Deliver:

*   [ ] More or less working code.
*   [ ] Note any relevant and interesting events that happened while you wrote the code.
    *   e.g. things you learned, things that didn't go according to plan.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-implemented` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 3: Testing and Debugging (tag name `4.1-tested`)
*(30% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] A set of test cases that you have personally run on your computer.
    *   Include a description of what happened for each test case.
    *   For any bugs discovered, describe their cause and remedy.
    *   Write your test cases in plain language such that a non-coder could run them and replicate your experience.
*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-tested` and push it to GitLab.


## Phase 4: Deployment (tag name `4.1-deployed`)
*(5% of your effort)*

Deliver:

*   [ ] **Tag** the last commit in this phase `4.1-deployed` and push it to GitLab.
*   [ ] Your repository is pushed to GitLab.
*   [ ] **Verify** that your final commit was received by browsing to its project page on GitLab.
    *   Ensure the project's URL is correct.
    *   Look for all of the tags in the **Tags** tab.
    *   Review the project to ensure that all required files are present and in correct locations.
    *   Check that unwanted files have not been included.
    *   Make any final touches to documentation, including the Sprint Signature and this Plan.
*   [ ] **Validate** that your submission is complete and correct by cloning it to a new location on your computer and re-running it.
	*	Run your program from the command line so you can see how it will behave when your grader runs it.  **Running it in PyCharm is not good enough!**
    *   Run through your test cases to avoid nasty surprises.
    *   Check that your documentation files are all present.


## Phase 5: Maintenance

Spend a few minutes writing thoughtful answers to these questions.  They are meant to make you think about the long-term consequences of choices you made in this project.

Deliver:

*   [ ] Write brief and honest answers to these questions:
    *   What parts of your program are sloppily written and hard to understand?
        *   Are there parts of your program which you aren't quite sure how/why they work?
        *   If a bug is reported in a few months, how long would it take you to find the cause?
    *   Will your documentation make sense to...
        *   ...anybody besides yourself?
        *   ...yourself in six month's time?
    *   How easy will it be to add a new feature to this program in a year?
    *   Will your program continue to work after upgrading...
        *   ...your computer's hardware?
        *   ...the operating system?
        *   ...to the next version of Python?
*   [ ] Make one final commit and push your **completed** Software Development Plan to GitLab.
*   [ ] Respond to the **Assignment Reflection Survey** on Canvas.
